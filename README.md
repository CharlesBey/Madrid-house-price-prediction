## Madrid Real Estate Price Prediction Model

This repository contains a real estate price prediction model for Madrid, Spain. The model is a random forest regressor that is trained on a dataset of listings from popular real estate portals. The model can be used to predict the price of a property based on its location, square meters built, built year, and whether or not it has parking.

### Context

The dataset consists of listings from popular real estate portals in Madrid. The dataset includes the following features:

* Location
* Square meters built
* Built year
* Has parking
* Price

### Location

Madrid is one of the most visited cities in Europe and is home to many important local and multinational companies. The real estate market in Madrid has been growing in recent years, but prices are still relatively attractive compared to other European capitals.

### Attractive Prices

The real estate market in Madrid has been in a growth phase for a few years now, which means that you can still find properties at very attractive prices (especially compared to other European capitals) but with still good chances of their value appreciating in the future.

### House Types

Individual homes are not common in the city center but do exist in the suburbs. Madrid also has a mix of new construction and existing apartments. Real estate prices in capital cities are generally the most expensive in a country, but it's not the case in Spain. The cost of property in Madrid is well below that of Barcelona and coastal areas.

### Model

The model is a random forest regressor, which is a type of machine learning algorithm that is well-suited for regression tasks. The model is trained on the dataset of listings from real estate portals.
